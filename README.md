# Adobe Gensolve

I created Adobe Gensolve project to focus on identifying, regularizing, and beautifying 2D Euclidean curves. This project processes line art represented as polylines, converting these into paths defined by cubic BÃ©zier curves. Key tasks include regularizing geometric shapes, exploring symmetry, and completing curves that are disrupted or partially occluded. Initially designed for hand-drawn shapes, my project enhances curve manipulation and visualization, with plans to handle raster images directly in future updates.



## Features

1. Curve Regularization: Transform irregular shapes into regular forms like circles, ellipses, and polygons.
2. Symmetry Exploration: Detect and apply symmetry transformations to enhance visual harmony.
3. Curve Completion: Complete partially occluded or disrupted curves using advanced algorithms.

## Installation

To get started with Curvetopia, clone this repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrasoonBagla/Adobe_Gensolve.git

cd Adobe_Gensolve
```
To install all the dependencies 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the FinalModel.py
 
    python3 FinalModel.py or python FinalModel.py

The input file should be renamed to "isolated.csv".
